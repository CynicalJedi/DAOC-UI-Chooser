Back to the Classics..

[** Changes from v4.03 to v5.0xBeta **] 

[** Option Chooser Program **]
Recompiled with Delphi 2009
Added more "Awareness" of Vista and Windows 7
Added User Account Control Prompt

Note:
  The “Publisher” field in the UAC window will indicate “Unknown” as it is too expensive for me to register with a company such as VeriSign to make it say something different.  I have no problem providing personal information to these types of companies to register my work but I dislike the idea of having to pay hundreds of dollar in fees each year to maintain my personal information in their database.
