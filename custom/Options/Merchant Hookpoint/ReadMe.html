    <p class="MsoNormal">The Merchant Hookpoint window is used to interact
    with a Merchant Hookpoint.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The window will appear when you right click on a
    hookpoint circle in a central keep or tower. &nbsp;The window is
    re-sizeable so you can see all the items available on the merchant at
    once. &nbsp;Your Personal Coin and Personal Bounty Point levels are
    shown in the window along with your Guild's Bounty Point levels.
    &nbsp;The listbox in the middle of the window will show you the current
    items that may be purchased at the current hookpoint. &nbsp;Different
    items will appear in the window depending on which hookpoint was
    selected on the keep or tower. &nbsp;The Personal Coins, Personal
    BPoints, Contract, and Guild BPoints buttons are used to toggle the
    method of payment for the selected item. &nbsp;The Buy button is used
    to purchase the selected item.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Note: &nbsp;If the hookpoint circles are not visible,
    hold down the shift key and right click on the keep or tower.
    &nbsp;When the Keep Status window appears click on the Hookpoint button
    at the bottom of the window to toggle the visibility of the hookpoint
    circles on or off.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">There is nothing shown when the window is
    concealed. &nbsp;The window is invisible with no graphics or controls
    to minimize the amount of memory used. &nbsp;Nothing will appear on the
    screen when you attempt to activate the window.</p>
