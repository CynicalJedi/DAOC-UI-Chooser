    <p class="MsoNormal">The tree list to the left shows all the available
    "Options" that can be changed by this program. Select the folder name
    in the tree list for the option you want to change. The text in this
    area will change to show you more information about the option. Double
    click on the name in the list to expand the folder to see more
    information about it. Browse through the list of available options in
    each folder by clicking on the names of each.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Options currently selected will appear with a
    green check mark beside them. Default options that are not selected
    will appear with a dark gray check mark beside them. Other unselected
    options will have a light gray check mark beside them.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">To select an option, click on the check mark next
    to the option you want to select. A popup dialog will appear as the
    change is being processed. Once the change is processed, the check mark
    beside the previously selected option in the group will turn gray and
    the check mark for the current selected item will turn green.</p>
