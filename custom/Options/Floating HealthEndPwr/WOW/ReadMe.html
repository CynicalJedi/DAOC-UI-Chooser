    &nbsp;Small widgets appear at the bottom of the window to indicate
    group member health and combat status. &nbsp;A caution indicator
    appears whenever one of your group member's health drops below 75%.
    &nbsp;A combat indicator appears when you enter combat mode. &nbsp;In
    addition a combat frame appears around the health globe and player's
    name when you are in combat mode. &nbsp;Colored "dots" are used to
    indicate group member's health status. &nbsp;Health status colors in
    order of highest to lowest are blue, green, yellow, red, and blank when
    dead or not available. &nbsp;The target window is similar to the one in
    WOW. Currently, the game client only provides information about your
    target's health. &nbsp;It does not provide information about your
    target's level, endurance, and power status like in WOW.</p>
