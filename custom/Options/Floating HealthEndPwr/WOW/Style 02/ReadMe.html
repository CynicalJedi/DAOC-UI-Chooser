    <p class="MsoNormal">This option allows you to choose this style for the
    Floating Health, Endurance, and Power windows.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">This is similar to the Player with Pet window used
    in WOW. &nbsp;Currently, the game client only provides information
    about your pet's health. &nbsp;It does not provide information about
    your pet's endurance, and power status like in WOW. &nbsp;It also does
    not provide your pet's level as a separate item but it is embedded with
    the pet's name.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Small widgets appear at the bottom of the window
    to indicate group member health and combat status. &nbsp;A caution
    indicator appears whenever one of your group member's health drops
    below 75%. &nbsp;A combat indicator appears when you enter combat mode.
    &nbsp;In addition a combat frame appears around the health globe and
    player's name when you are in combat mode. &nbsp;Colored "dots" are
    used to indicate group member's health status. &nbsp;Health status
    colors in order of highest to lowest are blue, green, yellow, red, and
    blank when dead or not available. &nbsp;The target window is similar to
    the one in WOW. Currently, the game client only provides information
    about your target's health. &nbsp;It does not provide information about
    your target's level, endurance, and power status like in WOW.</p>
