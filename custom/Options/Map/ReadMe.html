    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The Map window is used to display the geographical
    area for the zone your character is currently located in. &nbsp;The
    maps contain labels for various regions and points of interest.
    &nbsp;Map markers, which are continuously updated in the window, show
    your character and group mates locations within the zone. &nbsp;In
    addition, special quest markers are sometimes visible in the window to
    show the location of nearby quest NPCS and waypoint locations.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The window will appear when you click on the
    button labeled "Map" in the Main Menu or Command windows of the user
    interface. &nbsp;In addition you can type the command "/map" to
    activate the window.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p class="MsoNormal">The text at the top of the map window will show
    the name of the current area your character is located in such as
    Hibernia, Albion, Midgard, Shar Labyrinth, etc. &nbsp;The Info button
    is used to toggle the display of additional information about the
    current area that will appear at the bottom of the map window.
    &nbsp;The Mini button is used to toggle the view in the map window so
    the contents of the map window will change and follow your character as
    you move throughout the zone. &nbsp;The Quest button is used to toggle
    the visibility of nearby quest NPCs (yellow diamonds) and quest
    waypoints (red diamonds) in the map window.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p class="MsoNormal">The dropdown combo box on the left will show a
    list of each area within the current zone. &nbsp;The dropdown combo box
    on the right will appear when there are smaller zoomed in views
    available in within the current zone. &nbsp;When the custom mixed size
    maps are in use the right combo box will typically have an Overview
    item which when selected will switch to the 512 map size. &nbsp;You can
    select a new area from either of the two drop down lists to change the
    map view. &nbsp;Click on the Mini button at the top of the map window
    to return the window view to your characters current location with the
    smaller map sizes.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="MsoNormal">There is nothing shown when the window is
    concealed. &nbsp;The window is invisible with no graphics or controls
    to minimize the amount of memory used. &nbsp;Nothing will appear on the
    screen when you attempt to activate the window.</p>
