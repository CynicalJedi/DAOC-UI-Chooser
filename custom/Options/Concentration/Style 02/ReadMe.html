    <p class="MsoNormal">This style of Concentration window is a
    combination of the Group Buff and Concentration windows. &nbsp;The left
    side of the window displays each group member and the buffs that are
    currently cast on each. &nbsp;The right side of the window displays a
    list of each concentration buff you have cast along with the names of
    the players they are on. &nbsp;The remaining amount of your buff
    concentration "pool" is displayed at the bottom of the buff list.
    &nbsp;In addition, the current health, endurance, and power status for
    each group member is shown. &nbsp;You can select a group member by
    clicking on their name.</p>
