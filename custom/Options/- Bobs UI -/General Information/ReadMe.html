    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">If you are having problems with any custom UI here
    are some general things you can try to resolve them.</p>

    <div class='c2'>
      <h2>Make sure your system works with the Default Mythic UI</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="MsoNormal">If you are ever in doubt if a problem is caused by
    your custom UI, you can always try using the default Mythic UI to see
    if the same problem exists with it. &nbsp;Start the game client and
    enter your username and password. &nbsp;Make sure the Quick Entry field
    indicates "No Thank You" so no character will be preloaded at startup.
    &nbsp;At the "Select Your Character" screen click on the "Options"
    button. &nbsp;Find the "Interface-Skin Choice" option on the right side
    of the screen and make sure it says "Atlantis Skin". &nbsp;Selecting
    the "Atlantis Skin" option will tell the game client to use the default
    Mythic UI skin. &nbsp;Click the "Accept" button to close the Options
    window and save your settings. &nbsp;Select a character of your choice
    and then the "Play" button.</p>

      <h2>Select a custom UI that works with the latest version of the game
      client</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Mythic made several changes in the user interface
    with the 1.89 patch.&nbsp; Custom UIs that were made before the 1.89
    game patch will NOT work with the current version of the game client.
    &nbsp; Make sure your UI is at least compatible with the 1.89 version
    of the game client.&nbsp; The version of Windows (XP or Vista) and
    edition of the game client (TOA, Catacombs, DR, or LotM) does not
    matter. &nbsp; You can use a custom UI with XP or Vista and each
    edition of the game client.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <div class='c2'>
      <h2>Install your custom UI in the correct location</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The most common problem players have with a custom
    UI is not installing it in the correct location.&nbsp; Each custom UI
    has to be installed in the same location on your hard drive for it to
    be usable by the game client.&nbsp; Because of this, you cannot have
    two or more custom UIs installed and active at the same time in that
    location.&nbsp; The exact location for the UI is slightly different on
    each system and depends on how and where you installed the game
    client.&nbsp; The easiest way for you to figure out where this location
    is for your system/setup is to check the startup directory for your
    game client.&nbsp; Right click on the icon/shortcut that you use to
    startup the game and select the Properties menu item.&nbsp; On the
    Shortcut tab of the window that appears, look at the "Start In"
    directory name.&nbsp; That is the location where the game client was
    installed on your system.&nbsp; It will be something like:</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">"C:\Program Files\ElectronicArts\Mythic\DR"</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The "custom" directory for ALL custom UIs must be
    copied to a subdirectory of the game client named "game
    client\ui\".&nbsp; Before installing a new custom UI, browse to your
    "game client\ui\custom" directory and remove/delete any files that are
    already there.&nbsp; This is to prevent two sets of UI files from being
    loaded "on top" of one another.&nbsp; If you want to keep the copy of
    your current custom UI, just rename the "game client\ui\custom"
    directory to something else such as " game client\ui\custom_orig".</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Once you know the exact location on your system
    for the custom directory, and have cleared anything previously there,
    copy/move your new UI to that location.&nbsp; You can verify the files
    are in the correct location by looking at the location of your custom
    assets.xml file.&nbsp; It should have a location of "game
    client\ui\custom" and NOT something like "game
    client\ui\custom\custom".</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <div class='c2'>
      <h2>Configure your game client to use a custom UI skin</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Start the game client and enter your username and
    password.&nbsp; Make sure the Quick Entry field indicates "No Thank
    You" so no character will be preloaded at startup.&nbsp; At the "Select
    Your Character" screen click on the "Options" button.&nbsp; Find the
    "Interface-Skin Choice" option on the right side of the screen and make
    sure it says "Custom Skin".&nbsp; Selecting the "Custom Skin" option
    will tell the game client to use the Custom UI skin.&nbsp; Click the
    "Accept" button to close the Options window and save your
    settings.&nbsp; Select a character of your choice and then the "Play"
    button.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <div class='c2'>
      <h2>Use the default settings for your custom UI</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Many custom UIs have alternate options that you
    can choose using various methods.&nbsp; You should first use the
    default settings with a custom UI to insure you do not have problems
    with the default settings before you start selecting alternate
    options.&nbsp; That way if you do encounter problems, you can indicate
    it worked with the default option but not with option XXX.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <div class='c2'>
      <h2>Check your UI.log file</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The game client creates a new UI.log file each
    time it is started.&nbsp; It is a plain text file that can be opened
    with WordPad or NotePad and can be used to debug UI problems.&nbsp; If
    the game client crashes when you try to load a custom UI, the last few
    entries in the log file should help find the cause of the
    problem.&nbsp; The UI.log, along with in-game screenshots and some
    other data files will be located in the following directory:</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">"My Documents\Electronic Arts\Dark Age of
    Camelot"</p>
