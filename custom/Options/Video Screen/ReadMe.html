      <h1>Video Screen</h1>
    </div>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The Video Screen is a custom window that can be
    used to watch a movie or TV while in the game and performing mundane
    tasks like crafting.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The Video Screen window will appear when you click
    on the button labeled "Video" in the Main Menu or Command windows of
    the user interface.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The Video Screen feature works only in Windows XP
    and not in Vista. The window provides a "see through" screen that
    allows you to watch a video player that is open and running on your
    desktop in the background. It works by providing a sort of hole in the
    game so you can see whatever is on the video player on your desktop.
    There is no ability to control the video player and you can only view
    whatever is on the video player's screen.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">This option is known to work with the Windows
    Media Player, Zoom Player, Win Amp, Power DVD, Real Player, Savvy TV,
    VideoLan Client (VLC), and KTV media players.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">To use this window, switch to your desktop and
    start the video in one of the media players supported. Move the media
    player around on your desktop so the screen is where you want it to
    appear in the game. Switch to the game and open the Video Screen
    window. Insure the alpha level of the window is at 100% and that the
    screen selected supports the media player you are using. Move the
    screen so it appears over the media player and you can see the video.
    Resize the window as needed.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">You may notice some jittering of the movie as it
    is being played. To reduce the jitter open the windows task manager and
    switch to the Processes tab. Find your media player in the list and
    right click on it to open a popup window. Use the Set Priority option
    to raise the priority of the media player so it gets more of your CPU
    time.</p>

      <h2>- Conceal</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="MsoNormal">There is nothing shown when the window is
    concealed. &nbsp;The window is invisible with no graphics or controls
    to minimize the amount of memory used. &nbsp;Nothing will appear on the
    screen when you attempt to activate the window.</p>
