    <p class="MsoNormal">The Atlas window is a custom window used to
    display maps for each zone. &nbsp;Unlike the Map window, which only
    provides access to the maps for the current zone your character is in,
    the Atlas window provides access to all the maps, regardless of your
    character's location.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The window will appear when you click on the
    button labeled "Atlas" in the Main Menu or Command windows of the user
    interface. &nbsp;The maps contain labels for various regions and points
    of interest. &nbsp;Some of the maps also show the location of various
    quest NPCs and encounters.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The maps used in the Map window are "dynamic" and
    the game client only loads them as you enter into a new zone or area to
    reduce the amount of system resources used. &nbsp;The maps used with
    the Atlas however are "static", and the game client loads each of them
    all at once. &nbsp;Because of this, the Atlas maps can use a
    significant amount of system resources. &nbsp;To reduce the amount of
    system resources used by the Atlas, options are available that allow
    you to disable or set the style of the maps for each realm so only the
    maps you want to use are loaded.</p>
