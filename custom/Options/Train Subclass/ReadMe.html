      <h1>Train Subclass</h1>
    </div>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The Train Subclass window is used to train your
    champion abilities.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">The window appears when you are at least Champion
    Level 1 and right click on any base class (guardian, magician, etc)
    trainers other than the class you are in. &nbsp;For Example, if your
    base class is guardian, you cannot subclass train in the guardian skill
    but you can subclass train in any of the other base class skills.
    &nbsp;You get one champion skill point to spend on subclass training
    with each Champion level and can only have a maximum of ten. &nbsp;The
    number of remaining champion skill points you have to spend appears at
    the top of the display. &nbsp;In the center of the display are various
    icons arranged in the order which you can train in them. &nbsp;Click on
    any of the icons and then the Skill Info button to learn more
    information about the selected subclass skill. &nbsp;Click on the Train
    button to train in the selected skill or the Cancel button to ignore
    the selection and close the window. &nbsp;Champion re-specs can be
    purchased from an NPC in the King's chamber of each realm.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Note: &nbsp;Your Champion level (and available
    Champion Points) will NOT automatically increase as you gain Champion
    XP. &nbsp;You must interact with the King in your realm in order for
    your Champion status to be updated.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">There is nothing shown when the window is
    concealed. &nbsp;The window is invisible with no graphics or controls
    to minimize the amount of memory used. &nbsp;Nothing will appear on the
    screen when you attempt to activate the window.</p>
